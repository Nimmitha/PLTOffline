This directory contains the fits from the gain calibrations used as an input to further offline analysis.

Currently there are two files:
* GainCalFits_20150923.225334.dat, which was used for most of the analysis of the 2015 data.
* GainCalFits_20160501.155303.dat, the preliminary GainCal file for the 2016 data.

See the main documentation for more details on how to create these files. In particular, the latter file
was created with:
./GainCalFastFits /data2/GainCal_2016/gaincalfast_20160501.155303.avg.txt

This directory contains the scripts and results for running the luminosity calculation using zero counting on
the Slink data. This analysis was originally started by me (Paul) and extended by Daniel Gift in summer 2016.

The basic workflow is pretty similar to that for the accidental measurement, so consult the documentation for
that for more information. To summarize:

1) Run TrackLumiZeroCounting (it works pretty much the same way as MeasureAccidentals). You'll get an output
file called TrackLumiZC.txt.

This file is like the accidental rates file, except it contains a couple of extra columns. Specifically, the
columns are:
- time stamp start
- time stamp end
- number of triggers
- total number of tracks
- number of good tracks
- number of triggered bunches with collisions
- number of triggered bunches with collisions not containing any tracks
- number of triggered bunches with collisions containing tracks

The zero fraction is just the second-to-last field divided by the third-to-last field.

2) Use ParseCondDBData to combine that with the online fast-or data in the same way that you do for the
accidental data to get a combined rate file. Rename the files to some sensible pattern (like they are in this
directory).

3) Use the script PlotRatesZC.C (give it two arguments: the combined rate file and the fill number) to plot
the results. PlotRatesZCTime.C plots the results as a function of time instead.

See TrackLumiZeroCounting.cc and the plotting scripts for more details.

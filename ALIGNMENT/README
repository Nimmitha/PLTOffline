This directory contains alignment data for the PLT.

Alignment_IdealInstall.dat is the nominal alignment for the PLT as installed in January 2015. You can use it
as a starting point for further alignment studies.

Alignment_PLTMC.dat is used for the PLT MC.

The remainder of the files are derived from the 2015 data. I've selected a variety of fills which allow us to
measure the alignment changes induced by the magnet ramps. These are the Trans_Alignment_XXXX.dat files, which
include the translational and rotational corrections (CalculateAlignment also produces the rotational-only
files, but since these aren't really useful as a final product, I haven't included them here).

Of the data alignment files here, Trans_Alignment_4449.dat is the "standard" alignment used for the
calculation of accidentals and other similar tracking studies.

Please note: Although these files include alignment for scopes +z far hubs 21 and 29 (FED channels 22 and 23),
since these channels were not actually operational during the 25ns run period, the data for these scopes is
simply the nominal alignment.

Here's the full list of fills represented here. This covers the full 25ns 13 TeV pp run period (August
13-November 2), but not the 50ns run period. Note that for all of the alignment calculations, the GainCal file
GainCal/GainCalFits_20150923.225334.dat was used.

4201 (Aug. 13, Slink_20150813.033604.dat) magnet ON
4208 (Aug. 14, Slink_20150814.174340.dat) magnet OFF
4256 (Aug. 23, Slink_20150823.150455.dat) magnet ON
4341 (Sep. 09, Slink_20150909.215701.dat) magnet OFF
4381 (Sep. 17, Slink_20150917.014450.dat) magnet ON
4449 (Oct. 02, Slink_20151002.140454.dat) magnet ON*
4545 (Oct. 29, Slink_20151029.030456.dat) magnet OFF
4555 (Oct. 30, Slink_20151030.101718.dat) magnet ON
4565 (Nov. 02, Slink_20151102.084117.dat) magnet ON*

* In these two cases there was an intervening magnet ramp (during fills 4402 and 4457 respectively), but no
physics fills were actually taken with the magnet off.

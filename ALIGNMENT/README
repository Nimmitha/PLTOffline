This directory contains alignment data for the PLT.

Alignment_IdealInstall.dat is the nominal alignment for the PLT as installed in January 2015. You can use it
as a starting point for further alignment studies.

Alignment_PLTMC.dat is used for the PLT MC.

The remainder of the files are derived from the 2015 data. I've selected a variety of fills which allow us to
measure the alignment changes induced by the magnet ramps. These are the Trans_Alignment_XXXX.dat files, which
include the translational and rotational corrections (CalculateAlignment also produces the rotational-only
files, but since these aren't really useful as a final product, I haven't included them here).

Of the data alignment files here, Trans_Alignment_4449.dat is the "standard" alignment used for the
calculation of accidentals and other similar tracking studies for 2015. The standard 2016 alignment file is
Trans_Alignment_4892.dat. (Note that the 2016 alignment files were taken before the mask change, which in
theory should at least give us a more accurate measurement because we have a wider area available.)

Please note: Although these files include alignment for scopes +z far hubs 21 and 29 (FED channels 22 and 23),
since these channels were not actually operational during the 25ns run period, the data for these scopes is
simply the nominal alignment. For 2016 this is also true for -z near hub 5 (FED channel 0).

Here's the full list of fills represented here. This covers the full 25ns 13 TeV pp run period (August
13-November 2), but not the 50ns run period. Note that for the 2015 alignment calculations, the GainCal file
GainCal/GainCalFits_20150923.225334.dat was used, and the 2016 alignment calculations used
GainCal/GainCalFits_20160501.155303.dat.

* In these two cases there was an intervening magnet ramp (during fills 4402 and 4457 respectively), but no
physics fills were actually taken with the magnet off.

So far, no full alignment file has been made for 2017 from ./CalculateAlignment.
The first real alignment file we had was "hand-made" by Nick [Brey] and Stefan [Spanier] from a couple different alignment files.
They looked at the slope distributions for each channel and changed the values in the Trans_Alignment_[....].dat file until the distributions looked acceptable.
This was good enough for the time because the masks could be set appropriately.
This file was saved as Trans_Alignment_Nick.dat.
The alignment still was a little off, especially for 22, 23 so we worked with them more by hand until the distributions were close to what we had last year
(however this needs to be checked against the change in the beamspot location), but for now I think the alignment is good enough to begin some analysis.
The current alignment file is Trans_Alignment_2017MagnetOn_Prelim.dat.
There is no fill info because no single fill was used for this alignment file.
I think the next step would be to try ./CalculateAlignment with this alignment file as an initial value point.Â 
One word of warning on ./CalculateAlignment: For most 2017 data so far, it seems to bring the X slopes tightly to zero but blow up the Y distributions
so it may be worth it to see what is different between the fitting of 2016 ad 2017 data (the program should output a root file with all the fit info and histograms).
I would still use the gain cal file from mid May: GainCalFits_20170518.143905.dat.
The GainCal file from the beginning of June has some inconsistencies (more than the file I just mentioned) in the pixel address information.

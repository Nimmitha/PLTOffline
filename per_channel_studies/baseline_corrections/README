These 3 scripts were produced to plot values for the baseline corrections coming from the PLT automated workloop.

There are three of them because of the different formats the .txt workloop files were organized into over time:
(a) baseline_plots_old.py is for the first part of 2016 data, where FED0 and FED1 were not separated;
(b) baseline_plots_old2.py is for the second part of 2016 data, where FED0 and FED1 are separatedly noted in the files;
(c) baseline_plots.py is for 2017 data.

The script will loop over the workloop files, which have to be put in a subfolder named as the number of the fill(s) being considered; the script will require to input such number on the command line when calling it. 
It will eventually save plots for the corrections for each PLT telescope (Pixel and FEDs).

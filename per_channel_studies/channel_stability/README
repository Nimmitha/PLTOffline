These scripts were written to get histograms for the normalized rates and the standard pulls for each PLT telescope on a per fill basis, in order to have an idea of the stability and performance of each channel.

The normalization happens per NB4 in two different ways:
(1) with the average values of the 14 working channels (chs 0 and 4 always excluded) for that NB4 -> rates/pulls_single_fill.py
(2) with an average of the values of the 25 immediately previous NB4s for that specific channel -> rates/pulls_new_avg.py

The script reads .hd5 files that have to be saved in a subfolder named as the number of the fill being analyzed. This number has to be input when calling the script as it will be used to title plots.

The script will show histograms for each PLT telescope without automatically saving them (the scale may need further adjusting). Values of average and rms for each telescope are also included.

NOTE: the script mean_ch_err_plot.py was created to plot averages with their error bars for every telescope over a wide range of fills, but this was firstly done manually and some automation would indeed be necessary at some point.

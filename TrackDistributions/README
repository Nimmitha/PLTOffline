This directory contains the files containing the information on the slope and residual distributions of tracks
that are used for determining good quality tracks in MeasureAccidentals. Right now there are two files which
should meet all of your needs:

TrackDistributions_MagnetOn.txt -- track distributions with magnet on (see note below)
TrackDistributions_MagnetOff_4341.txt -- track distributions with magnet off, derived from fill 4341

The format of the files should be self-explanatory: the first line is the number of active scopes, and then
each parameter is followed by the mean and sigma values for that parameter.

Note: I'm not quite sure what fill TrackDistributions_MagnetOn.txt comes from. I had thought it was 4444 or
4449, but I can't reproduce it. However since this was the one used for the accidental studies it should be
saved here!

To create your own track distributions for an arbitrary fill, just invoke MeasureAccidentals as normal -- it
doesn't matter what you use as the input track distribution file -- and then take the resulting
TrackDistributions.txt file that is produced.

For example,
./MeasureAccidentals /raid/PLT/SlinkData_2015/Slink_20150930.234122.dat GainCal/GainCalFits_20150923.225334.dat ALIGNMENT/Trans_Alignment_4449.dat dummy.txt

The magnet-off track distributions file here was produced with the following command:
./MeasureAccidentals /raid/PLT/SlinkData_2015/Slink_20150909.215701.dat GainCal/GainCalFits_20150923.225334.dat ALIGNMENT/Trans_Alignment_4341.dat dummy.txt

The PulseHeight directory contrains all the necessary scripts to produce a number of different plots which
correspond to the pulse height study.


1) Produce the gain calibration files which are required to run the PulsHeight code. 
   Just run the following bash script
                
                  ./gainCalFastFits.sh


2) The PulseHeights_new.cc script takes as an input a Fill and a gain calibration file and 
   plots the charge distribution as an output. It is important that the pixels with bad fit
   results should be masked. To implement it, the code reads the fit result of every individual
   pixel in the fiducial region and mask (ignores) those with bad fits. The fit information is
   contained in the rootfiles which can be produced by the following command:

                ./GainCalFastFits_modified.cc gaincalfast_<timestamp>.avg_Err.txt


3) If you want to reproduce the pulse height over integrated luminosity plots for the selected Run-2
   data, you just have to run:

                ./PulseHeights.sh

   All the necessary information (fills, gaincal files etc) is hardcoded.
   Otherwise, if you want to select a different fill and plot the pulse height, you can just run:

                ./PulseHeights_new.cc  [Slink data] [gaincal file] [Fill]

  The 3rd argument has been added in order to assign the fill number to the corresponding produce histogram
  which is then stored in the rootfile. This is just a method to automate the process and be able to run
  multiple fills with the bash script.
